Horizontal tabs provide a space to hold one to several panes of full width bands, and toggle between them via tabs.

Titles are optional, and a background can be applied by adding `data-rh-band-background` to the `rh-horizontal-tabs-container`. `data-rh-theme="dark"` is supported as well to make title text legible on dark backgrounds.
