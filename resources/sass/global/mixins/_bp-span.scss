title: bp-span()
category: Global - Mixins
---

Breakpoint Span is a small helper mixin that allows you to pass [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) span parameter and [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) data in the same mixin. There is no complex logic here, this just removes the need to wrap every span mixin in a breakpoint mixin.

@mixin bp-span($span, $breakpoint)

-    __$span:__ susy span parameters
-    __$breakpoint:__ associated [breakpoint variable](global_-_variables.html#Breakpoints) or settings

```inline
.class-name {
    @include bp-span(3 of 12, $breakpoint-sm-min);
}
```

*/

@mixin bp-span($grid, $breakpoint) {
    @include breakpoint($breakpoint) {
        @include span($grid);
    }
}
