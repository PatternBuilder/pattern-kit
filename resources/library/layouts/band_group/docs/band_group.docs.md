##Band group layout

The Hero layout is container for other bands. The Hero allows you to assign a fixed or static background at mobile and desktop (768px) screen resolutions.

This layout provides you the ability to wrap a single background image around several bands. This will initially be used to hold the top most page content (utility bar, navigation, hero content) but can easily be used for other purposes in other parts of a page.

```html_example
    {% include "band_group.twig" %}
```
